# Hash Table in Assembly MIPS
## The Hash function:
  The index of the hash will be the modulo of the value (key) to be inserted, deleted, searched by the hash's size. 

## Colision 
 The Hash table size is 16, and to treat the colision a doubly linked list will be implemented. 
 The doubly linked lists need to be dynamically allocated and they do not have a max legnth. 
 
## Implementation of:
  * Insert
  * Delete 
  * Search 
  * Display 
  
## Extra 
 * Insert and Delete keys(values) ordered into the doubly lists. 
 * Binary Search
