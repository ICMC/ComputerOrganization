# Hash Table in Assembly MIPS

## Implementation of:
  * Insert
  * Delete 
  * Search 
  * Display 

The Hash table size is 16, and to treat the colision a doubly linked list will be implemented. 
## The Hash function:
  The index of the hash will be the modulo of the value (key) to be inserted, deleted, searched by the hash's size.
